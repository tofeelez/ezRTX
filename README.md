ezRTX

Ray tracing resource pack for Minecraft for Windows (Bedrock Edition).

Converted all blocks that can be converted in the current version of Minecraft (pre-release version not included). All textures have not been subjected to changes in appearance, color, saturation with the exception of weather and particles for a better sense of realism compatible with vanilla. Maximized balanced glow, metallic and smoothness effects to achieve the best comfort experience without RTX graphics artifacts. No unnecessary luminous elements and blocks, only what should be luminous is luminous. The luminous blocks have a proper vanilla hierarchy and are set up so that blocks with the same light level glow the same way. Every aspect was taken into account to logically identify the objects. Also included is an improved settings panel with an integrated V-Sync switch and fixes for all known bugs.

For a better experience, ezRTX has also been adapted to BetterRTX, which improves RTX visuals and allows you to activate glowing items: Ender Chest, End Crystal, Enchanting Table Book, Experience Orb and mobs.

The Demo version only includes blocks conversion. No emission on blocks, no entity emission, no change of weather, particles, fogs and no bug fixes.

The Full version includes all of these.
